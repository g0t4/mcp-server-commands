# mcp-server-commands

An MCP server to run commands.

Published to npm as [mcp-server-commands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-server-commands) using this [workflow](https://github.com/g0t4/mcp-server-commands/actions)

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful what you ask this server to run!
> In Claude Desktop app, use `Approve Once` (not `Allow for This Chat`) so you can review each command, use `Deny` if you don't trust the command.
> Permissions are dictated by the user that runs the server.
> DO NOT run with `sudo`.

## Tools

Tools are for LLMs to request, i.e. Claude Desktop app. Claude Sonnet 3.5 intelligently uses both tools, I was pleasantly surprised.

- `run_command` - run a command, i.e. `hostname` or `ls -al` or `echo "hello world"` etc
  - Returns STDOUT and STDERR as text
- `run_script` - run a script! (i.e. `fish`, `bash`, `zsh`, `python`)
  - Let your LLM run the code it writes!
  - script is passed over STDIN
  - `run_script` == `run_command` + script over STDIN
  - Claude has been pretty creative with this, i.e. using `cat` as the interpreter to create new files!

## Prompts

Prompts are for users to include in chat history, i.e. via `Zed`'s slash commands (in its AI Chat panel)

- `run_command` - generate a prompt message with the command output

## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation

There are two ways to install mcp-server-commands. Using mcp-get provides a one-step installation:

```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install mcp-server-commands
```

### Using npm directly

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Use the published npm package

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-commands": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-commands"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Use a local build (repo checkout)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-commands": {
      // works b/c of shebang in index.js
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-server-commands/build/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Logging

Claude Desktop app writes logs to `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-server-commands.log`

By default, only important messages are logged (i.e. errors).
If you want to see more messages, add `--verbose` to the `args` when configuring the server.

By the way, logs are written to `STDERR` because that is what Claude Desktop routes to the log files.
In the future, I expect well formatted log messages to be written over the `STDIO` transport to the MCP client (note: not Claude Desktop app).

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
